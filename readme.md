# Coffee Delivery
This is a challenge project developed along the React JS specialization created by Rocketseat.

 The objective was to develop an application capable of storing product data and manipulating its values with ContextAPI, also storing it in LocalStorage for better manipulation since the present application does not have a backend. At the end the products selected by the user are shown on screen.

An external API called "VIACEP" was used, capable of providing postal code data in order to automate the filling of the address by the user.

At the end, with the address filled in, selected products and the chosen payment method, the user can finalize the order by being forwarded to the final page.
